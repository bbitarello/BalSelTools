\title{Calculate non-central statistic (NCD1)}
\usage{
ncd1(
  x = x,
  tf = 0.5,
  fold = T,
  w = 3000,
  by.snp = TRUE,
  mid = FALSE,
  ncores = 2,
  selectwin = "val",
  targetpos = NULL,
  minIS = 2,
  label = NULL,
  verbose = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data.table object}

\item{tf}{Target frequency}

\item{fold}{Logical. If TRUE, NCD1 will use minor allele frequencies.}

\item{w}{Window size in bp. Default is 1000}

\item{by.snp}{Logical. If TRUE, windows are defined around each SNP
in the input data. Else, slidding windows in the range first pos:last pos
will be used.}

\item{mid}{Logical. If TRUE runs NCD centered on a core SNP frequency instead of a pre-defined tf. Requires targetpos.}

\item{ncores}{Number of cores. Increasing this can spead things up for you.
Default is 4.}

\item{selectwin}{Select window. "val" returns the window with the lowest test. "maf" returns the window
which has the lowest difference between its central MAF and the tf."mid" returns the window
centered closest on a value provided by the user under targetpos."all" returns all windows (idea for when the user wants to select windows after scanning a genome)}

\item{targetpos}{Position of the target SNP. Only needed for mid==T}

\item{minIS}{Minimum number of informative sites. Default is 2. Windows with
less informative sites than this threshold are discarded.}

\item{label}{An optional label to include as the last column of the output}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, progress reports will be printed as the
function runs.}
